# Version 07 aims to define a function to take the order not for a single person but for all the people in a table
# We can choose the number of items (not only1 as in version 04)

# Write a function ask_number_items(item_name)
# - The function asks the user to input a number of items of type item_name
# - The function returns an integer with the number of items

# Change the function ask_client so it uses ask_number_items inside

# Debug the program to see how the flow goes over the functions

print("Hello to the Python bar!")

# Configuration Variables
